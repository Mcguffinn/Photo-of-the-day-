One of the most popular websites at NASA is the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). In fact, this website is one of the [most popular websites](https://analytics.usa.gov) across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the `concept_tags` parameter is set to `True`, then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.
